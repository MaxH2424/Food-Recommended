# Food-Recommended

Food-Recommended is a mobile app that provides a cornucopia of information to the user such as food pricing, ratings, user comments, 
and unique feautures such as the direct comparison of two foods. Our focus is providing clean, unbiased information to the user to
help them decided where they want to eat tonight. We want to accomplish this through a friendly UI, a rewards program, and a simple track
of getting the user to finding their desired restaurant.


# Purpose

Provide the most information possible for a user to help narrow their decisions down. A new platform that doesn't provide any bias towards the restaurants, but rather just information provided by other users and ratings.
