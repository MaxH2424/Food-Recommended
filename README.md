# Food-Recommended

Food-Recommended is a mobile app that provides a cornucopia of information to the user such as food pricing, ratings, user comments, 
and unique feautures such as the direct comparison of two foods. Our focus is providing clean, unbiased information to the user to
help them decided where they want to eat tonight. We want to accomplish this through a friendly UI, a rewards program, and a simple track
of getting the user to finding their desired restaurant.
